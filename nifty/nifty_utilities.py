def get_slice_list(shape, axes):

    Helper function which generates slice list(s) to traverse over all
    combinations of axes, other than the selected axes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape: tuple
        Shape of the data array to traverse over.
    axes: tuple
        Axes which should not be iterated over.

    Yields
    -------
    list
        The next list of indices and/or slice objects for each dimension.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If shape is empty.
    ValueError
        If axes(axis) does not match shape.
