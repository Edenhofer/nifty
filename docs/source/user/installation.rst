Installation for users
======================


If you only want to to use NIFTy in your projects, but not change its source
code, the easiest way to install the package is the command:

    pip install --user nifty7

Depending on your OS, you may have to use `pip3` instead of `pip`.
This approach should work on Linux, MacOS and Windows.


Installation for developers
===========================

Information for the installation for developers you can
find `here <https://ift.pages.mpcdf.de/nifty/dev/index.html>`_.
