class ScalingOperator(EndomorphicOperator):
    """Operator which multiplies a Field with a scalar.

    Parameters
    ----------
    factor : scalar
        The multiplication factor
    domain : Domain or tuple of Domain or DomainTuple
        The domain on which the Operator's input Field is defined.

    Notes
    -----
    :class:`Operator` supports the multiplication with a scalar. So one does
    not need instantiate :class:`ScalingOperator` explicitly in most cases.

    Formally, this operator always supports all operation modes (times,
    adjoint_times, inverse_times and inverse_adjoint_times), even if `factor`
    is 0 or infinity. It is the user's responsibility to apply the operator
    only in appropriate ways (e.g. call inverse_times only if `factor` is
    nonzero).

    Along with this behaviour comes the feature that it is possible to draw an
    inverse sample from a :class:`ScalingOperator` (which is a zero-field).
    This occurs if one draws an inverse sample of a positive definite sum of
    two operators each of which are only positive semi-definite. However, it
    is unclear whether this beviour does not lead to unwanted effects
    somewhere else.
