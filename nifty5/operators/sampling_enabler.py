    Parameters
    ----------
    likelihood : :class:`EndomorphicOperator`
        Metric of the likelihood
    prior : :class:`EndomorphicOperator`
        Inverse metric of the prior
    iteration_controller : :class:`IterationController`
        The iteration controller to use for the iterative numerical inversion
        done by a :class:`ConjugateGradient` object.
    approximation : :class:`LinearOperator`, optional
        if not None, this linear operator should be an approximation to the
        operator, which supports the operation modes that the operator doesn't
        have. It is used as a preconditioner during the iterative inversion,
        to accelerate convergence.
