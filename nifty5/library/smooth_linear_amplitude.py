    """Turns a white Gaussian random field into a smooth field on a LogRGSpace.

    Composed out of three operators:

        sym @ qht @ diag(sqrt_ceps),

    where sym is a :class:`SymmetrizingOperator`, qht is a :class:`QHTOperator`
    and ceps is the so-called cepstrum:

    .. math::
        \\mathrm{sqrt\\_ceps}(k) = \\frac{a}{1+(k/k0)^2}

    These operators are combined in this fashion in order to generate:

    - A field which is smooth, i.e. second derivatives are punished (note
      that the sqrt-cepstrum is essentially proportional to 1/k**2).

    - A field which is symmetric around the pixel in the middle of the space.
      This is result of the :class:`SymmetrizingOperator` and needed in order
      to decouple the degrees of freedom at the beginning and the end of the
      amplitude whenever :class:`CepstrumOperator` is used as in
      :class:`SLAmplitude`.

    The prior on the zero mode (or zero subspaces for more than one dimensions)
    is the integral of the prior over all other modes along the corresponding
    axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    target : LogRGSpace
        Target domain of the operator, needs to be non-harmonic.
    a : float
        Cutoff of smoothness prior (positive only). Controls the
        regularization of the inverse laplace operator to be finite at zero.
        Larger values for the cutoff results in a weaker constraining prior.
    k0 : float, list of float
        Strength of smoothness prior in quefrency space (positive only) along
        each axis. If float then the strength is the same along each axis.
        Larger values result in a weaker constraining prior.

def SLAmplitude(*, target, n_pix, a, k0, sm, sv, im, iv, keys=['tau', 'phi']):
    '''Operator for parametrizing smooth amplitudes (square roots of power
    spectra).

    The general guideline for setting up generative models in IFT is to
    transform the problem into the eigenbase of the prior and formulate the
    generative model in this base. This is done here for the case of an
    amplitude which is smooth and has a linear component (both on
    double-logarithmic scale).

    This function assembles an :class:`Operator` which maps two a-priori white
    Gaussian random fields to a smooth amplitude which is composed out of
    a linear and a smooth component.

    On double-logarithmic scale, i.e. both x and y-axis on logarithmic scale,
    the output of the generated operator is:

        AmplitudeOperator = 0.5*(smooth_component + linear_component)

    This is then exponentiated and exponentially binned (in this order).

    The prior on the linear component is parametrized by four real numbers,
    being expected value and prior variance on the slope and the y-intercept
    of the linear function.

    The prior on the smooth component is parametrized by two real numbers: the
    strength and the cutoff of the smoothness prior
    (see :class:`CepstrumOperator`).

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_pix : int
        Number of pixels of the space in which the .
    target : PowerSpace
        Target of the Operator.
    a : float
        Strength of smoothness prior (see :class:`CepstrumOperator`).
    k0 : float
        Cutoff of smothness prior in quefrency space (see
        :class:`CepstrumOperator`).
    sm : float
        Expected exponent of power law.
    sv : float
        Prior standard deviation of exponent of power law.
    im : float
        Expected y-intercept of power law. This is the value at t_0 of the
        LogRGSpace (see :class:`ExpTransform`).
    iv : float
        Prior standard deviation of y-intercept of power law.

    Returns
    -------
    Operator
        Operator which is defined on the space of white excitations fields and
        which returns on its target a power spectrum which consists out of a
        smooth and a linear part.
