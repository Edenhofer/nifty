    ----------
    domain : RGSpace
        Domain of the operator. It has to be two-dimensional and have shape
        `(2N, 2N)`. The coordinates of the lower left pixel of the dirty image
        are `(-N,-N)`, and of the upper right pixel `(N-1,N-1)`.
    uv : numpy.ndarray
        2D numpy array of type float64 and shape (M,2), where M is the number
        of measurements. uv[i,0] and uv[i,1] contain the u and v coordinates
        of measurement #i, respectively. All coordinates must lie in the range
        `[-0.5; 0,5[`.
