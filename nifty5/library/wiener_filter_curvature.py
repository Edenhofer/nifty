    This operator implements the second derivative of the

    Parameters
    ----------
    R : LinearOperator
        The response operator of the Wiener filter measurement.
    N : EndomorphicOperator
        The noise covariance.
    S : DiagonalOperator
        The prior signal covariance
    iteration_controller : IterationController
        The iteration controller to use during numerical inversion via
        ConjugateGradient.
    iteration_controller_sampling : IterationController
        The iteration controller to use for sampling.
