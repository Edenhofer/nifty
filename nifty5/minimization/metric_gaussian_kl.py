class MetricGaussianKL(Energy):
    """Provides the sampled Kullback-Leibler divergence between a distribution
    and a Metric Gaussian.

    A Metric Gaussian is used to approximate another probability distribution.
    It is a Gaussian distribution that uses the Fisher information metric of
    the other distribution at the location of its mean to approximate the
    variance. In order to infer the mean, a stochastic estimate of the
    Kullback-Leibler divergence is minimized. This estimate is obtained by
    sampling the Metric Gaussian at the current mean. During minimization
    these samples are kept constant; only the mean is updated. Due to the
    typically nonlinear structure of the true distribution these samples have
    to be updated eventually by intantiating `MetricGaussianKL` again. For the
    true probability distribution the standard parametrization is assumed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mean : Field
        Mean of the Gaussian probability distribution.
    hamiltonian : StandardHamiltonian
        Hamiltonian of the approximated probability distribution.
    n_samples : integer
        Number of samples used to stochastically estimate the KL.
    constants : list
        List of parameter keys that are kept constant during optimization.
        Default is no constants.
    point_estimates : list
        List of parameter keys for which no samples are drawn, but that are
        (possibly) optimized for, corresponding to point estimates of these.
        Default is to draw samples for the complete domain.
    mirror_samples : boolean
        Whether the negative of the drawn samples are also used,
        as they are equally legitimate samples. If true, the number of used
        samples doubles. Mirroring samples stabilizes the KL estimate as
        extreme sample variation is counterbalanced. Default is False.
    _samples : None
        Only a parameter for internal uses. Typically not to be set by users.

    Note
    ----
    The two lists `constants` and `point_estimates` are independent from each
    other. It is possible to sample along domains which are kept constant
    during minimization and vice versa.
