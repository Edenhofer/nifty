class EnergyAdapter(Energy):
    """Helper class which provides the traditional Nifty Energy interface to
    Nifty operators with a scalar target domain.

    Parameters
    -----------
    position: Field or MultiField
        The position where the minimization process is started.
    op: EnergyOperator
        The expression computing the energy from the input data.
    constants: list of strings
        The component names of the operator's input domain which are assumed
        to be constant during the minimization process.
        If the operator's input domain is not a MultiField, this must be empty.
        Default: [].
    want_metric: bool
        If True, the class will provide a `metric` property. This should only
        be enabled if it is required, because it will most likely consume
        additional resources. Default: False.
